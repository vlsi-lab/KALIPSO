# **KALIPSO**

## (K)yber-(A)ccelerated (L)ow-latency (I)mplementation for (P)olynomial-multiplication for RI(S)C-V (O)ptimization 

## Introduction
In the **ntt_intt_kyber** repository you can find an example of how a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) hardware accelerator works. 
NTT-INTT accelerator has been integrated and tested.

[X-Heep](https://github.com/esl-epfl/x-heep.git) (eXtendable Heterogeneous Energy-Efficient Platform) is a RISC-V microcontroller described in SystemVerilog that can be configured to target small and tiny platforms as well as extended to support accelerators. NTT-INTT and [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/tree/master/crypto_kem) algorithms are compiled using [PULP toolchain](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain).


## Getting started
Get the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/vlsi-lab/ntt_intt_kyber.git
```
After cloning the repository, you can build and simulate using:

```sh
make mcu-gen
make questasim-sim
```

## Running Applications

You can run NTT and INTT applications:

```sh
make app-NTT IP_TYPE=NTT
make run-NTT-questasim IP_TYPE=NTT
```
```sh
make app-INTT IP_TYPE=INTT
make run-INTT-questasim IP_TYPE=INTT

```
